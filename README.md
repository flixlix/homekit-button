The following options are available from the YAML configuration.

### Action Object

The action object is a simple object that can be used to call different actions when interacting with the card. The following options are available:

| Option            | Default | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                |

#### Open Dialog Action

The `open-dialog` action is a special action, exclusive to this card. It allows you to open a dialog with a custom card inside of it. This can be used to show a more detailed view of the entity, or to show a different card when tapping the button.

When using this action, the `card` option is required. The Header of the Dialog uses the optional `title` option, and will default to the `name` of the entity.

### Secondary Configuration

With the secondary configuration, you can add a secondary text to the card. This can be used to show the current temperature of a thermostat, or the current brightness of a light, for example. Also supports [Actions](#action-object).

| Option   | Default | Required | Description                                            |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `top`    | none    |          | See [Secondary Field](#secondary-field) for more info. |
| `bottom` | none    |          | See [Secondary Field](#secondary-field) for more info. |

#### Secondary Field

Options for the secondary field.

| Option              | Default   | Required | Description                                                                                         |

| `double_tap_action` | more-info |          | The action to call when double-tapping the card. See [Action Object](#action-object) for more info. |

### State Label Configuration

With the state label configuration, you can decide how the state is displayed. Note that this does not affect the state of the entity, or the way the card handles state changes. This is purely for text display purposes.

| Option     | Default | Required | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity`   | none    | ‚úÖ       | The entity to show the state of. Most likely will be a `input_text` that is updated by an automation.                                                    |
| `humanize` | true    |          | Wether to humanize the state. For example, `on_running` will be displayed as `On running`. If set to `false`, the state will be displayed exactly as is. |

## Basic Example

This code:

```yaml
type: grid
cards:
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: switch.ac
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: switch.skylight
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: light.bed_light
```

Should give you something like this:

![Basic Example](examples/01.png?raw=true "Basic Example")

## Using Open Dialog Action

This code:

```yaml
type: grid
cards:
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: switch.ac
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: switch.skylight
  - type: custom:homekit-button
    entity: light.bed_light
    tap_action:
      action: open-dialog
      card:
        type: entities
        entities:
          - entity: switch.ac
          - entity: switch.skylight
          - entity: light.bed_light
```

Should not differ from the previous example, but when tapping the last card, it should open a dialog with the entities inside of it.
